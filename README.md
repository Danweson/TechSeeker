# TechSeeker

In order to obtain a Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering at the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) 
which is part of the schools of the University Institute of Cost (UIC) in partnership with the University of Buea, 
we are asked to work on a topic under the coordination of our Supervisor. The one we have chosen is "Design and 
Implementation of an Application for Technician's Seeker for Solving Technical Problems: Case of Douala". The 
realization of the project which is talking in the topic will generally allow the people who need technical
assistance to find the technicians where they are located and according to their problems especially in 
case of emergency, they will be able to contact the technicians. We opted for the agile methodology and
its Scrum framework for the software development process. We did the literature review of this project,
we used UML for the design of the diagrams. We implemented the project using Java Android for the mobile
application and the Symfony framework based on the PHP programming language for web services with the 
REST API and the web application that will use to administrate the system. MySQL is the Database Management
System chosen for the system's database implementation.
